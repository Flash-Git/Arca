## UNFINISHED/UNAUDITED - DO NOT USE

### SUMMARY
Through a set of autonomous contracts I'm going to enable video game style trading boxes between all Ethereum accounts.
This includes the manipulation of any Ethereum asset as well as individual actions available through 2nd party function calls.

Want to buy a cryptokitty but don't have the up front Eth?

Maybe the seller will give it to you in exchange for 3 of your kitties, a tank, 3ICO tokens and a signed message of his choice.

### WHAT CAN BE TRADED?
Ether:
You can place positive or negative Ether balances in your box, (if it's negative, you are requestion Ether to go along with the items you are trading).

Ownables:
This includes ERC721s as well as anything that has an owner, ENS names, your place in a multisig, etc.

Balanceables:
This mainly includes ERC20s, but anything that has a balance updated on an Ethereum Contract also works.

Arbitrary function calls:
A lot of contracts require you to be the owner in order to call certain functions. If you are in that position, you can temporarily lend out this feature to whoever you do business with.

### FUTURE
I can imagine a whole market based on these features but I have neither the money nor the time to work on this aspect of the project myself.
